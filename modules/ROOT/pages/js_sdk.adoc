= Hello GeoDB in JS

This tutorial explains how to get started with GeoDB in Node.js and/or in the browser.
In a hurry?
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/nha/geodb-nodejs-sample
----

First, import the library:

[source,js]
----
const geodb = require('geodb');
const websocket = require('websocket') // <1>
----
<1> Library import for the web socket package, only required on nodeJS


We then read the environment variables from the environment (adapt to your build process in the browser). These credentials can be found at https://geodb.io/security
[source,js]
----

const USER_TOKEN = process.env.GEODB_USER_TOKEN // <1>
const API_KEY = process.env.GEODB_API_KEY       // <2>

if (!USER_TOKEN) {
  console.log('Missing USER_TOKEN')
}

if (!API_KEY) {
  console.log('Missing API_KEY')
}
----
<1> a `UserToken` uniquely identifies an account
<2> an `apiKey` contains the necessary permissions for publishing and subscribing.

Both are essential in order to use geodb.
Time to instantiate a new geodb instance.

[source,js]
----
const g = geodb({
  host: 'geodb.io',   // <1>
  type: 'ws',         // <2>
  protocol: 'https',  // <3>
})
----
<1> This is only useful for when geodb is deployed in hosted environments
<2> Only 'ws' (websockets, the default) is supported for now
<3> always prefer 'https' - this is useful in hosted environments

We now have `g` holding an instance that will be able to connect.
No HTTP or WebSocket connection has been opened up yet.

First, let's define two helper functions.
Publish is the first, it will use `g` to publish a few

[source,js]
----
const publish = function publish() {
  console.log('Publishing!')

  g.publish(
    {
      payload: {
        msg: 'hello geodb'                           // <1>
      },
      channel: '#tutorial',                          // <2>
      location: {                                    // <3>
        lon: 2.1204,
        lat: 48.8049
      },
    },
    (err, data) => {                    // <4>
      console.log('published', err, data)
    },
  )
}
----
<1> the "payload" is a JSON containing arbitrary data. It will be delivered as-is to the consumers
<2> the #channel you want to publish to. You can think of this as a chat room, or a twitter #hashtag. There are more elaborate ways of communicating, refer to the chapter on link:channel.adoc[channels (@sub, #channel and regex matching)]
<3> (optional) the location around which you want to publish. In this case the coordinates are Versailles, a French city near Paris
<4> we generally follow this pattern in callbacks. A third argument `metadata` is also passed which contains


We now have a function to send data, we need the corresponding function to receive it on the other end!

[source,js]
----

const subscribe = function subscribe() {
  return g.subscribe(
    {
      channel: '#tutorial', // <1>
      location: {               // <2>
        radius: '50km',
        lon: 2.3522,
        lat: 48.8566
      },
    },
    (err, data, metadata) => { // <3>
      console.log('data received in Paris#test', err, data, metadata)
    },
  )
}

----
<1> the same channel as above. If they don't match, we will not receive messages
<2> The location. This time, the coordinates correspond to Paris, which is less than 50km from Versailles
<3> the "data" argument will contain the message above `{msg: 'hello geodb'}`


We now have:
- a function to send data
- a function to send data
The following sets up the

[source,js]
----
g.on('ready', () => {             // <1>
   console.log('Geodb ready')

   setTimeout(publish, 2000)      // <2>
    subscribe()                    // <3>
})

geodb.on('error', evt => {
  console.log('error')
})

geodb.on('disconnect', evt => {
  console.log('Disconnected')
  process.exit()                  // <4>
})
----
<1> the 'ready' event is fired when geodb.io is reachable and the authentication is correct
<2> continuously publish every 2 seconds
<3> subscribe, need to do it only once. The callback will be fired every 2.5 seconds
<4> on NodeJs

[source,js]
----
g.connect({ // <1>
  userToken: USER_TOKEN,
  apiKey: API_KEY,
})
console.log('Connecting...')


setTimeout(() => { // <2>
  console.log('Disconnecting!')
  geodb.disconnect()
}, 15000)

----
<1> we connect to the server, using our credentials. If the credentials are correct, the 'ready' event will be fired. Otherwise, the 'error' event will be fired.
<2> after 15 seconds running, we trigger a disconnect. Once done, the `disconnect`event will be triggered

=== Conventions

This is a convention that most callbacks follow: `(error, data, extra)`.
Most of the time checking for `(error, data)` is enough, but If you find yourself thinking "I wish geodb exposed more data", it is worth looking at the third `extra` argument.
If this argument does not contain what you are looking for, feel free to open an issue!

All this is already available in a sample repository - feel free to clone it - it has tests, a permissive licence, it runs on NodeJs and on the browser with web pack! https://github.com/nha/geodb-nodejs-sample[js-sample]
