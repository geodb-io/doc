One of the most unique features of GeoDB is the ability to publish and subscribe based on geolocation.

This makes it easy to build real-time apps that need to rely on users or items locations.

        location: {       // <1>
          radius: '50km', // <2>

<1> The `location` filter can be applied along with other filters such as #channel, jsonPath
<2> the `radius` accepts a natural way of expressing it. m, km, cm, mm, yard, foot, feet, inch, mile, furlong  are all valid radiuses units. Without unit, meters are assumed.
<3> longitude
<4> latitude
<5> annotation: we recommend either using variable names or annotating your data


== Coordinate system

Coordinates of points on the sphere's surface are addressed by a pair of floating point numbers that denote longitude and latitude. The range of longitude is −180 through 180, which wraps around the whole of the sphere: −180 and 180 denote the same line. The range of latitude is −90 (the south pole) through 90 (the north pole).

For a more detailed explanation of this, consult the Wikipedia article on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system[geographic coordinate system].


== Projections used

GeoDB supports the WGS84 World Geodetic System’s reference ellipsoid and geographic coordinate system (GCS).
