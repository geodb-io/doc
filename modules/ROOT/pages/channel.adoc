= Channels

The primary means of splitting communications are via #channels.

== #channel

Although not strictly necessary, we recommend prefixing your channels with "#", as they are used in the same way a hashtag is. Think of channels as hashtags, or chat rooms.

== Regex-based channel

(upcoming)

GeoDB also supports a regex-based subscription model. For instance, let's say you are building a chat app for your sales team, with the following chat rooms:

- `#sales-team-us`
- `#sales-team-fr`
- `#sales-team-en`
- `#sales-team-ru`
- `#sales-team-ch`

Now let's say you want to to subscribe (or publish) to all of these at once.
Use the `#sales-team-*` regex pattern like so:

[source,js]
----
geodb.publish({chanelRegex: "#sales-team-*", payload: "Attention all sales people!"})
----

NOTE: The exact flavor of regex used if the Java regex pattern.
See the Java documentation for java.util.regex.Pattern for details https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html

NOTE: Think about using #channels if possible before using @publisher-id as it often turns out to be easier to use.
